		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am very deeply rooted in my Afrakan culture, and am dedicated to restoring some of the lost/untold history, culutre, spirituality, and life styles of the Afrakans in the diaspora (The Americas & Europe). That is an extremely important mission for me, and for all Afrakans across the globe. Everything I do in life is centered around that misson, which include the gifts & talents givien to me by the creator. My spirituality is centered around the sciences & spiritual system of my ancestors of the the Hapi valley (Nile river) in Ancient Kemet (Egypt) which we call a Ma’atian. Since the ancient Afrakans spirituality there was based upon Ma’at who represents truth, justice, harmonious balance, and resiprosity. The driving force of their culture.</p>
